title: Devlog Falling Arrow - One Sheet GDD

2017 has been a year of starting way more projects than finishing and the sticking point always seems to be 3D assets.

The abition for my projects far outweight my 3D Modelling and animation skills, resulting in weeks of frustration before shelving projects *"temporarily"*.

With this in mind and some extra time off over Christmas, I've decided to sink my teeth into (yet another) new project but this time designing around my limitations from the getgo.

Not only will this project avoid humanoid characters like the plague but I'm also keeping geometry to a bare minimum and using only assets that can be created in Google Blocks.

I will be documenting the entire process here starting with my one sheet game design document.

#### Falling Arrow
![Lovecraft Alien](/static/images/lovecraft-alien.jpg)
###### A Tetris, Lovecraft, Hunger Games Mashup

**Genre:**	VR Puzzle Archery
**Target Audience:** Teen+
**Controls:** 6DOF Motion Controllers
**Thematic Setting:** Lovecraftian Sci-Fi
**Tech Stack:** Unity 2017, Google Blocks
**Platform:** Oculus Rift

**Game Moment:** Frantically destroying the alien cubes that fall with ever increasing speed using your quick reflexes, expert aim and clever tacticts to earn the highest score and beat your friends.

**Core Player Experience:** Fire arrows at the cubes before they hit the floor. Different cubes have different behaviours. Some fall faster than others. Some take more damage to destroy. Some explode taking others with them and some slow down time.

The game increases in levels which get faster and faster. You score based on the level reached, cubes destroyed and the complexity of combo shots.

When a cube hits the floor, itâ€™s game over. Highest scores win.
